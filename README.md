# we all know the character tony stark just like he stated is a 'billionaire, playboy and philantrophist' when cap asked him what was HE when the suit is taken away from him.His powers come from the "IRON-MAN" which he creates initially when he was kidnapped where he suffered damage to his heart. The suit was made to keep him living.
#Tony's wife is 'pepper' and has a daughter 'morgan'. Stark has a piece of shrapnel near his heart. His magnetic chest plate keeps the shrapnel from reaching his heart and killing him. He must recharge the chest plate every day or die. In the marvel cinematic universe, the role of iron-man was played by Robert Downey Jr.
