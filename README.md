# my favourite super-hero would be iron-man.
# we all know the character tony stark just like he stated is a 'billionaire, playboy and philantrophist' when cap asked him what was HE when the suit is taken away from him.Tony owns and runs a tech company. His powers come from the "IRON-MAN" which he creates initially when he was kidnapped where he suffered damage to his heart. The suit was made to keep him living. He however modifies the suit further with cool gadgets and weapons and becomes the IRON-MAN we all know.
